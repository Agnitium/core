itemstats v1.2
==============

itemstats is just another version of the many mods that exists to add some item stats to your web pages.  I don't take credit for any ideas.  I found a mod that does this on the eqdkp forums, picked the ideas apart and decided to make a complete overhaul of it.  The main goal was to create a mod that is as self-containted as possible, and to require the most minimal changes to the system you are incorporating it in.


Features:

- Item stats download from Allakhazam, including item set bonuses.

- Databased cached items to speed up the reload time of items, and make data easily accessible from multiple sources (EQdkp and phpBB installations can share data easily).

- Support for local or remote icon cache for items.

- Quick and easy to follow instructions on how to modify your EQdkp and phpBB installations.

- Minimal changes to the EQdkp and phpBB code for easy re-installation in case of upgrades.

- Easily change the look of your item display with the included stylesheet.

- Fairly clean, commented and modular code if you feel like making any changes, or are just curious on how things work.


EQdkp features:

- "mouseover" tooltips for icon and color coded item listing on the following pages: 'List Items', 'View Member', 'View Raid', 'View Event'.

- Display of item stats and links to info sites on the 'View Item' page

- New [item][/item] bbcode to the news page which creates item colored links to Allakhazam with mouse over tooltip.


phpBB features:

- New [item][/item] bbcode which creates item colored links to Allakhazam with mouse over tooltip.
